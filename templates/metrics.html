        <h1>Technology and Metrics</h1>
        <p>The core of our handwriting recognition technology is Microsoft's TrOCR, an encoder-decoder model that uses a vision Transformer as an encoder and a classic text Transformer as a decoder. Using a text Transformer as a decoder allows TrOCR to leverage an understanding of natural language in its transcriptions.</p>

        <p>We fine-tune TrOCR on the IAM Handwriting Database to improve its performance on handwritten text. By training for 3 epochs using HuggingFace's Transformers library, we were able to achieve a character error rate of only 8.6%.</p>
